# PHP New Relic Agent multi-platform

## Ideas

New Relic agent for `x86_x64` is ready to compile the PHP extension and getting up fast when we build Dockerfile. However, it's a pain for `arm64` architecture.
This repository purpose is to cut down the build time for everyone want to use PHP New Relic Agent by using [Multi-stage build](https://docs.docker.com/build/building/multi-stage/).
